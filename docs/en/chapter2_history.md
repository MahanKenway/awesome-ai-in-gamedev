# Chapter 2: History and Evolution of Game AI

The evolution of AI in games can be divided into four main eras, each characterized by specific technologies and landmark games.

## 2.1 The Golden Age of Arcade (1970 - 1980)
During this era, AI in the true sense did not exist; the goal was to create a "convincing illusion of intelligence."
- **Space Invaders (1978)**: One of the first examples of simple AI. As enemies were killed, the movement speed of the remaining fleet increased. This was a clever design decision to increase the challenge.
- **Pac-Man (1980)**: A major milestone. Each of the four ghosts (Blinky, Pinky, Inky, Clyde) had a different algorithm and thus a unique "personality," making the player feel they were facing different entities.

## 2.2 Modern Era and Emergent Behaviors (2000s)
In this period, the focus shifted from simple rules to more complex decision-making systems.
- **F.E.A.R. (2005)**: This game set new standards by introducing the **GOAP (Goal-Oriented Action Planning)** system. Enemies in this game could plan their sequence of actions in real-time to achieve a goal (e.g., flanking the player).
- **Halo 2**: Brought the popularity of **Behavior Trees**, which were a scalable alternative to Finite State Machines (FSM).

## 2.3 The Machine Learning Revolution (2010 - 2020)
The entry of data and learning algorithms into the game world.
- **The Sims**: Utilizes one of the most complex AI systems where each Sim has unique needs, goals, skills, and personality.
- **Skyrim**: Introduced the **Radiant AI** system. In this system, NPCs have their own daily lives (sleeping, working, eating) and operate independently within the game world.

## 2.4 The Era of Generative AI (2020 and Beyond)
The current era where AI creates not just behavior, but content as well.
- **LLMs and Generative AI**: Enabling endless dialogues, dynamic stories, and 3D models in real-time.
- **AlphaGo and MuZero**: Demonstrating the power of Reinforcement Learning in defeating world champions and running complex games without human training.
