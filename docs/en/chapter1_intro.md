# Chapter 1: Introduction and Core Concepts

## 1.1 What is AI in Video Games?
Artificial Intelligence (AI) in video games refers to a collection of algorithms, techniques, and systems designed to create intelligent, autonomous, and realistic behaviors within a game, particularly for Non-Player Characters (NPCs). This field of programming is a journey that began with very simple rules (e.g., "if the player is close, attack") and has evolved into highly advanced techniques like Machine Learning and Generative AI.

## 1.2 Strategic Importance of AI
The video game industry is currently one of the most profitable industries in the world. In 2022, its revenue surpassed the combined revenue of the music and film industries. In such a massive market, AI plays several vital roles:
- **Cost Reduction**: Automating manual processes.
- **Faster Development**: Speeding up content creation and game testing.
- **Dynamic Experience**: Creating games that are different and unique for every player.
- **Immersion**: Increasing the believability of the game world through human-like NPC behaviors.

## 1.3 Key Applications in the Modern Industry
AI is utilized in various aspects of game development:
1. **Intelligent NPCs**: Characters that make decisions based on environmental conditions.
2. **Procedural Content Generation (PCG)**: Automatic creation of maps, levels, textures, and even music.
3. **Pathfinding**: Finding the best way to move through complex environments.
4. **Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA)**: Automatically changing the game's difficulty level based on the player's real-time skill.
5. **Personalization**: Adapting the story and gameplay to the specific taste of each user.
