# Chapter 4: Case Studies - Analyzing Famous Games

In this chapter, we examine how major games have used AI to create a different experience.

## 4.1 Red Dead Redemption 2 (RDR2)
This game is one of the pinnacles of AI in open-world games.
- **Living NPCs**: Every non-player character has a daily routine. They wake up in the morning, go to work, rest in a cafe, and return home at night.
- **Reactivity**: NPCs react to the player's appearance, their weapon, and even their previous behaviors. This has created an emotional bond between the player and the game world.

## 4.2 No Man's Sky
A pioneer in **Procedural Content Generation (PCG)**.
- **Massive Scale**: Generating over 18 quintillion unique planets.
- **How it works**: Using base data (temperature, atmosphere, gravity), algorithms create the entire ecosystem, flora, and fauna of each planet in real-time.

## 4.3 Forza Motorsport - Drivatar System
A revolution in racing games.
- **Learning from the Player**: This system learns your actual driving style and creates a digital version of you (Drivatar) that races against others when you are offline.
- **Multi-line System**: The new AI can use multiple racing lines to overtake and cut corners, just like a professional driver.

## 4.4 Minecraft
- **Advanced Pathfinding**: Using optimized versions of A* for creature movement in a fully destructible world.
- **LazyAI**: A system for optimizing AI performance on large scales.
- **AI Mods**: The user community has built mods where NPCs can independently build cities, farm, and trade with each other.
