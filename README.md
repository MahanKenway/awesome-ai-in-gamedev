## 🌟 Introduction
AI in video games refers to systems and algorithms that allow Non-Player Characters (NPCs) to act intelligently and independently. It has evolved from simple rule-based systems to complex Machine Learning models.

## 📜 History of Game AI
- **Arcade Era (1970-1980):** Simple rule-based logic.
  - *Space Invaders (1978):* Adaptive difficulty through speed.
  - *Pac-Man (1980):* Unique "personalities" for ghosts.
- **Modern Era (2000s):** Emergent behaviors.
  - *F.E.A.R. (2005):* Introduced GOAP (Goal-Oriented Action Planning).
  - *Halo 2:* Popularized Behavior Trees.
- **Machine Learning Revolution (2010-2020):**
  - *The Sims:* Complex FSM and Utility systems.
  - *Skyrim:* Radiant AI for daily NPC lives.

## 🧠 Core Techniques & Algorithms
- **FSM (Finite State Machines):** Basic "If-Then" logic (Idle, Patrol, Chase).
- **Behavior Trees:** Scalable and modular decision-making.
- **GOAP (Goal-Oriented Action Planning):** Dynamic sequence of actions to reach a goal.
- **Pathfinding (A* Algorithm):** The standard for NPC navigation.
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Agents learning through trial and error (e.g., AlphaGo).

## 🎮 Case Studies
- **Red Dead Redemption 2:** Advanced NPCs with daily routines and emotional memory.
- **No Man's Sky:** Procedural generation of 18 quintillion planets.
- **Forza Motorsport:** *Drivatar* system that learns from real player driving styles.
- **Minecraft:** Advanced pathfinding and community-driven AI mods (LazyAI).

## 🛠 Tools & Frameworks
- **Unity ML-Agents:** Reinforcement learning in Unity.
- **Inworld AI:** Generative AI for lifelike NPCs.
- **Scenario:** AI-generated game assets.

## 🚀 Future of AI in Gaming
- **Generative AI:** Real-time story, asset, and world creation.
- **Autonomous NPCs:** Characters that build their own narratives.
- **Simulated Realities:** Game worlds that live even when you are offline.
